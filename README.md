# gatsby-source-graphql-whitelabel

This works the same as [Gatsby's GraphQL source plugin](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-graphql), but allows for whitelabeling the module itself. Specially useful for integrations with things that has GraphQL support with only a tiny amount of work on the URL and authentication part.
